OK so I have the project that I'm working on locally that is simply an Android app and I am not wanting to develop it locally but on a remote server seen in connections.Md. This is because I'm currently on WSL and that remote server is an actual metal based installation of Ubuntu with Android Studio. So I wanted to making the following changes to my app I need an actual kiosk mode where I can't just exit out of the app Because I press the home button or I shut the tablet off or something or I scrolled up from the very bottom of the screen if that makes sense I can put controls or physical security controls and cover up the home button or cover up the power button and sound buttons But from within the app I don't want to be able to scroll away from the kiosk mode unless I put in the password. Does this all make sense And then yeah that's pretty much it you should be able to get a read on what I'm actually trying to build and please keep it clean please keep it modular let me know any suggestions that you have to make because I want to be able to make a simple chat interface to have a chat with remote LLM and then I also want to have kiosk mode where people will just simply have voice chats and the LLM response will be printed out in text on the screen but then also the tablet will use text to voice using Google's built in features to do that to speak out the app. And I have not yet added the emulator for what I'm trying to build this on is gonna be a Samsung Galaxy tablet a 7 and I would need to download the skin for that tablet and then also make a proper emulator for it. Thank you.
